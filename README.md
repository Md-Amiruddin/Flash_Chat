## Goals

The objective is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into my Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

## Features

<ul>
<li>Uses Firebase Auth to authenticate and keep track of users.</li>
<li>Firebase Firestore keeps track of the messages on the platform.</li>
<li>A user with an account can only initiate chat with another user only if he has his registered email id.</li>
<li>Once a user initiates chat with other user on the platform, a unique key is assigned for both of them and their messages are tracked under that unique key.</li>
<li>The email ids' under 'connections' for a particular user, show up in the chat room screen as chats.</li>
</ul>
